This project includes three methods trained and tested on Potsdam dataset. The detailed requirement can be found at [SPNet](https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/SPNet), 
[D-LinkNet](https://github.com/zlckanata/DeepGlobe-Road-Extraction-Challenge), [FastFCN](https://github.com/wuhuikai/FastFCN). D-LinkNet in this project can be used in PyTorch >=1.0.0. <br>
You can use them with different backbone and traing image size.<br>
Also, multiscale MPM is built in SPNet/models/customize.py, you can choose any of them in the backbone.
